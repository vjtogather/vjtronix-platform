# VJtronix Web

Public-facing web application for VJtronix, built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4.

## Structure

```text
src/app              App Router pages, layout, and global styles
src/components/ui    Reusable UI primitives

src/components/home  Landing page sections
src/constants        Brand and navigation constants
src/lib              Shared utilities

```

## Architecture Notes

The current landing page is static and server-rendered. Client Components should be introduced only when a feature needs browser state, effects, or event-driven interactivity.

See `docs/architecture/WEB_FOUNDATION.md` for the first architecture decision record.
